#### Features:
- Can translate one key or several in one component.
- Text Component may contain not only the key for translation.
- Automatic translation of keys into runtime when the user changes the language.
- Simple select between different system of localization library (XML,JSON,CSV).
- Static localizator, dont need put controller into the scene, just text component.

#### Main scripts:
- **Localizator.cs**
  - Main static class.
- **GetLocalizeText.cs**
  - A component that is bound to UI.Text and that sets localized text by one or several keys.
- **IParseableLocalize.cs**
  - All parsers of any type must implement this interface. The interface is set to Localizator.
- **LocalizeXML.cs**
  - Parser that takes localization keys from an xml file and returns them to Localizator class.
- **LocalizeJSON.cs**
  - Parser that takes localization keys from an json file. This parser works on [SimpleJSON](https://github.com/Bunny83/SimpleJSON) developed by Markus GÃ¶bel (Bunny83).
- **LocalizeCSV.cs**
  - Parser that takes localization keys from an CSV file.
- **SwitchTypeParser**
  - Developer may be set type Parsing in this script. 
  - The script can be located in the same scene as the Localizator calls. So in the scene before, for example "Loading" scene.
  - Script sets autofill UI.Dropdown, which fill all available languages. Also Dropdown component auto sets in current lang. 
  - Add loading available languages in Localizator from files .xml, json.
- **Locale**

3.  Add Text Component (Canvas)
4.  Set your text in Text Component and put your keys or one key for localize into scopes [] (Example: `[Play] 12354 [Now]`)
